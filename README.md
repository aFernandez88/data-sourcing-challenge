**Movie Reviews**

In this project I am extracting data from two different sources: The New York Times API and The Movie Database (TMDb) API. I am combining these data sets to help people find movie reviews and related movies through a recommendation system.



**Requirements**

Python

requests library

API keys for The New York Times and TMDB




**Usage**

Obtain API keys for The New York Times and TMDB.

Set the API keys in the appropriate variables in the script.

Run the script, and the extracted data will be saved in a CSV file.
